## Exercise 1

Write a class component, with an input that takes the data from the user, the data is then displayed (rendered) as an `h1` in the page.

If no text is provided it should display a text saying "no data provided!" 

> You should use the `onChange` event

## Exercise 2 / Optional with hooks

Refactor the previous exercise, this time using a function component and the `useState` hook. Take a look at `useState` in the "Hooks" block of React part. 

## Exercise 3

In a function component, create a `div` which contains 2 inputs and one button.

Each of these should be a separate child component, all rendered by a parent component called App.

You should collect the data from the inputs and make it available in the parent component (using a function would work for this).

Input 1 should collect the user's email.
Input 2 should collect the user's password.

When the button (also a separate component) is clicked then you should alert the data collected by the two inputs.

> You should use the `onChange` and `onClick` events
