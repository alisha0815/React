## Exercise 1 

Create a child component called Counter that will only update if the number of click's is odd and ignore the click with even number. So the counter is increasing by 1 on every click but in the page we only see the odd numbers.

You are going to need a button, and a text that displays the counter from the state increasing when the number of clicks is odd:

## Exercise 2

Create a euro to dollar (and viceversa) convertor. It needs to take the input from one component and then render the converted value from a child component.

It is up to you which component does the actual conversion...

Extra:
- Use an external API to get real exchanges rates, you can use this one: https://currencylayer.com/
(they will ask you to register and will give you a free plan and an api key)

> Use js fetch to get the data from the API: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch

```
fetch(`http://www.apilayer.net/api/live?access_key=${your_api_key_here}`)
.then( res => res.json())
.then( response => console.log(response))
.catch( error => console.log(error))
```

## Exercise 3

Create a form that gets email and password and a component with an alert initially not visible. When submit it should check in an array of users if the email exists and if so, if the corresponding password is correct. 

If email and password are correct you should display a positive message with a green background otherwise negative message and red background but in both cases a series of messages:

    This message will disappear in 3
    This message will disappear in 2
    This message will disappear in 1
    This message will disappear in 0

and make the alert component invisible again i.e. unmount it.

> Use `setInterval` to display every message for 1 second
