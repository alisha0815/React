// ## Exercise 2

// Create a parent class component inside which you define two arrays of equal length, the first will have 5 firstnames and the second 5 lastnames.

// Create 2 children class components â€“ one to display the firstnames and one to display the lastnames so that they are rendered side by side with matching order.
